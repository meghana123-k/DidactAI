# DidactAI – Intelligent Learning Assistant

## Purpose
DidactAI is a major academic project designed to improve student learning by combining
progressive text summarization, automated assessment, behavioral integrity monitoring,
and learning analytics into a single intelligent system.

The goal is to help students not just read content, but understand it at multiple depths
and validate their learning through structured evaluation.

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to understand dense academic content and to evaluate whether
they have truly mastered a topic. Existing learning tools either summarize content or
conduct assessments independently, without adapting the depth of learning or measuring
actual improvement.

There is a lack of systems that:
- Provide learning at progressive levels of depth
- Automatically assess understanding based on learned content
- Measure learning improvement quantitatively
- Maintain integrity during assessments

---

## Why This Project Exists
DidactAI exists to bridge the gap between passive learning and measurable understanding.

Unlike traditional tools, DidactAI:
- Generates multiple levels of summaries using different NLP strategies
- Automatically creates adaptive quizzes from the summarized content
- Tracks learner behavior during assessments
- Provides analytics to quantify learning improvement

This makes DidactAI a complete learning cycle rather than a single-purpose AI tool.
