# Problem Statement

## Background
Students often face difficulty in understanding complex academic topics due to the lack of
structured explanations and effective evaluation mechanisms. Most existing learning platforms
either provide explanations without measuring comprehension or conduct assessments without
ensuring conceptual clarity.

This disconnect results in passive learning, where students consume content but are unable to
evaluate their actual level of understanding.

---

## Identified Gap
Current AI-based systems and large language models primarily focus on generating explanations
when prompted. However, they do not:
- Adapt explanations to different depths of understanding
- Integrate assessment directly with the learning process
- Measure learning improvement through structured analytics

Summarization alone is insufficient because it only delivers content without validating
comprehension. Similarly, assessment alone is insufficient because it evaluates performance
without ensuring conceptual understanding.

---

## Proposed Solution
DidactAI is an intelligent learning assistant designed to bridge the gap between content
understanding and learning evaluation.

The system provides three levels of explanation:
- Basic Summary for quick understanding
- Detailed Summary for in-depth learning
- Conceptual Summary for conceptual clarity and reasoning

After learning through these summaries, students can attempt automatically generated quizzes
to evaluate their understanding. The system then provides detailed performance analytics and,
upon successful completion, generates a digital certificate as proof of topic mastery.

---

## Scope and Limitations
- Input formats include text and document-based content
- Output is provided in structured textual explanations and quizzes
- The system does not include facial recognition, real-time video monitoring, or plagiarism detection
- The focus is on learning outcomes rather than user surveillance

# Viva Pitch – DidactAI

Many students struggle to understand complex topics and often do not have a clear way to
measure whether they have truly learned the material.

DidactAI addresses this problem by combining progressive learning and evaluation in a single
system. It explains any given topic at three different levels—basic, detailed, and conceptual—
allowing learners to understand the content step by step.

After learning, students can take automatically generated quizzes based on the same content.
The system evaluates their performance, provides analytics on their understanding, and
generates a certificate upon successful completion.

Unlike existing systems that only explain content, DidactAI integrates explanation,
assessment, and analytics to form a complete learning cycle.
