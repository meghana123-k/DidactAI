# DidactAI – Machine Learning & Logic Design

## 1. Summarization Strategies

### Basic Summary (Extractive)
- Uses TF-IDF / TextRank
- Ranks sentences based on importance
- Selects top-k sentences
- Preserves original wording

Purpose: Quick overview

The extractive summarization module generates a basic overview by selecting the most
informative sentences directly from the original text.

### Methodology
1. The input text is segmented into sentences using an NLP-based tokenizer.
2. Very short or non-informative sentences are filtered using word-count thresholds.
3. Each sentence is treated as an individual document and represented using TF-IDF vectors.
4. Sentence importance is computed using the mean TF-IDF score.
5. Sentences are ranked by importance and a fixed proportion is selected.
6. The selected sentences are reordered to preserve the original document flow.

### Rationale
TF-IDF is chosen for extractive summarization due to its explainability and efficiency.
Using mean TF-IDF prevents bias toward longer sentences while maintaining relevance.
Preserving sentence order ensures coherence and readability in the final summary.

### Detailed Summary (Abstractive)
- Uses pretrained transformer models (T5 / BART)
- Rewrites content into concise explanations
- Controls output length via decoding parameters

Purpose: In-depth understanding


The abstractive summarization module generates rewritten summaries that preserve the
semantic meaning of the original text.

### Methodology
1. The input text is segmented into sentence-based chunks to respect transformer
   context-length constraints.
2. Each chunk is summarized independently using a pretrained transformer-based
   sequence-to-sequence model.
3. The intermediate summaries are merged and summarized again to ensure coherence
   across the entire document.
4. Summary length is controlled using deterministic decoding parameters.

### Rationale
Transformer-based models such as T5 and BART are capable of generating fluent and
context-aware summaries. Hierarchical summarization ensures scalability to long
documents while maintaining readability and coherence.

### Conceptual Summary
- Performs keyword extraction and Named Entity Recognition
- Uses dependency parsing to identify relationships
- Generates concept-focused explanations

Purpose: Conceptual clarity and reasoning


The conceptual summarization module focuses on extracting key concepts
and their relationships rather than generating rewritten text.
Concept normalization and filtering are applied to reduce noise and ensure that extracted concepts are meaningful and relevant.
### Methodology
1. The input text is processed using spaCy for Named Entity Recognition
   and dependency parsing.
2. Important concepts are identified using named entities and frequent
   noun phrases.
3. Concepts are ranked based on frequency and relevance.
4. Simple subject–verb–object relationships are extracted to capture
   conceptual connections.
5. Structured explanations are generated to support conceptual clarity.

### Rationale
Unlike abstractive summarization, conceptual summarization emphasizes
understanding relationships and core ideas, enabling learners to grasp
the underlying structure of the topic.

## Quiz Generation Module

The quiz generation module creates multiple-choice questions automatically
from summarized and conceptualized content.

### Methodology
- Beginner-level questions are generated by masking key terms from extractive summaries.
- Intermediate-level questions test conceptual understanding using key concepts.
- Advanced-level questions are derived from subject–verb–object relationships to assess reasoning.

### Rationale
Template-based quiz generation ensures deterministic output, explainability,
and alignment with the learned content, making the assessment reliable and
academically defensible.

## Quiz Validation & Difficulty Scoring

Automatically generated quiz questions are validated before being presented
to the learner to ensure quality, relevance, and fairness.

### Validation Rules
- Minimum question length
- At least four answer options
- Exactly one correct option
- No answer leakage within the question text
- Duplicate question removal

### Difficulty Scoring
Each validated question is assigned a normalized difficulty score (0.0–1.0)
based on:
- Question length
- Similarity between options
- Cognitive difficulty level
- Presence of explanatory feedback

This ensures that learners are evaluated using reliable and appropriately
challenging questions.

## 3. Behavioral Integrity Scoring
- Tracks:
  - Time per question
  - Idle duration
  - Tab switching
  - Rapid answering patterns
- Computes a rule-based suspicion score
- Flags or auto-submits quiz if threshold is exceeded

Note: This module is rule-based with ML-inspired reasoning and is not claimed as deep learning.
## Behavioral Integrity Monitoring

The integrity monitoring module evaluates quiz-taking behavior using
non-intrusive behavioral analytics.

### Tracked Signals
- Time spent per question
- Idle time
- Tab switching frequency
- Irregular response timing

### Scoring Logic
Each behavioral signal contributes to a weighted suspicion score.
The final integrity score is computed as:

Integrity Score = 1 − Suspicion Score

### Decision Thresholds
- Score ≥ 0.8: Normal behavior
- Score 0.6–0.79: Warning
- Score < 0.6: Flagged attempt
Thresholds are empirically chosen based on reasonable human behavior patterns, such as typical reading speed and natural variation in response times. The system avoids binary cheating decisions and instead computes a weighted suspicion score to ensure fairness.

## Analytics & Learning Gain

The analytics module evaluates learner performance using multiple metrics
to ensure fair and meaningful assessment.

### Metrics
- Accuracy: Proportion of correctly answered questions
- Weighted Score: Performance adjusted by question difficulty
- Integrity-Adjusted Score: Final score adjusted using behavioral integrity
- Learning Gain: Difference between post-learning and baseline scores

### Rationale
This multi-metric approach ensures that performance reflects not only
correctness, but also question difficulty and assessment integrity.

## Certificate Generation

Certificates are issued only when learners demonstrate both
concept mastery and academic integrity.

### Eligibility Criteria
- Minimum final score threshold
- Minimum integrity score threshold
- Participation across all difficulty levels

### Rationale
This ensures certificates represent genuine learning outcomes
rather than raw performance or compromised assessments.
